# MY_RADAR
This project is a 2D visualization panel showing a simulatation of air traffic (AT).\
\
In my first version of the simulation, we have 2 types of entity:\
• aircrafts\
• control towers\
The basic rules for the my_radar are as follows:\
• aircrafts fly from given places to other ones.\
• aircrafts appear on the simulation panel when they take off.\
• aircrafts disappear from the simulation panel when they land on.\
• aircrafts move in a straight line at given constant speeds.\
• aircrafts colliding with another one is destroyed and disappear from the simulation panel.\
• control areas allow aircrafts to collide with each other without being destroyed and they can continue on their way.\
• control towers don’t move and have control areas on the map.\
• control towers appear on the simulation panel at launch\

You can toggle the visibility of the plane and tower sprites with **S**, and the visibility of the hitboxes with **L**.\
